  # When Go packages are built, buildsys will vendor in dependent Go code for
  # that package and bundle it up in a tarball. This env variable is consumed
  # and used to configure Go to directly download code from its upstream source.
  # This is a useful early signal during GitHub actions to see if there are
  # upstream Go code problems.
