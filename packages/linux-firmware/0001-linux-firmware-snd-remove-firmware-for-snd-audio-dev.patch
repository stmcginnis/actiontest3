Subject: [PATCH] linux-firmware: snd: remove firmware for snd/audio devices

Bottlerocket does not configure drivers for audio devices for any of its
kernels. Hence, we do not need to ship firmware for these devices. The
following list maps the drivers as they are named in WHENCE to the
kernel config option for reference and easy searchability should we need
to find the right firmware to add when adding a driver to our kernel
configuation:

* snd-korg1212 - CONFIG_SND_KORG1212
* snd-maestro3 - CONFIG_SND_MAESTRO3
* snd-ymfpci - CONFIG_SND_YMFPCI
* snd-sb16_csp - CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
* snd-wavefront - CONFIG_SND_WAVEFRONT
* mtk-sof - CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_MTK_TOPLEVEL
* snd-hda-codex-ca0132 - CONFIG_SND_HDA_INTEL && CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_CA0132
* snd_soc_sst_acpi - CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_SST_ACPI
* snd_intel_sst_core - CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_SST
* snd_soc_catpt - CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_CATPT
* snd_soc_avs - CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_AVS
* snd_soc_skl - CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_SKL
* cs35l41_hda - CONFIG_SND_SOC_C35L41* && SND_HDA_SCODEC_CS35L41*
