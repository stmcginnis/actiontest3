Subject: [PATCH] linux-firmware: Remove firmware for Accelarator devices

Bottlerocket does not ship drivers for specialty accelarator hardware.
Without those drivers the firmware is of no use. Drop the firmware from
our images to reduce image size.

The following list maps the driver names as specified in WHENCE to
kernel config options. This creates an easy reference should we need to
ship addiitonal firmware when adding drivers.

* rvu_cptpf - CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_OCTEONTX_CPT &&
  CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_OCTEONTX2_CPT
* ccp - CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_CCP
* qat - CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_QAT
* liquidio - CONFIG_LIQUIDIO
* nitrox - CONFIG_NITROX
* knav_qmss_queue - CONFIG_KEYSTONE_NAVIGATOR_QMSS
* nfp - CONFIG_NFP
* fsl_mc bus - CONFIG_FSL_MC_BUS
* inside-secure - CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_SAFEXCEL
