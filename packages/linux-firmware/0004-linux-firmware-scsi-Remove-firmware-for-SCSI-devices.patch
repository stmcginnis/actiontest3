Subject: [PATCH] linux-firmware: scsi: Remove firmware for SCSI devices

Bottlerocket does not configure drivers for most SCSI devices for any of
its kernels. Without the driver support, there is no point in providing
firmware for these devices. The list below maps driver names as
specified in WHENCE and maps them to kernel config options to enable us
to easily add firmware when necessitated by driver addition.

* advansys - CONFIG_SCSI_ADVANSYS
* qla1280 - CONFIG_SCSI_QLOGIC_1280
* qlogicpti - CONFIG_SCSI_QLOGICPTI
* isci - CONFIG_SCSI_ISCI
* BFA/BNA - CONFIG_BNA && CONFIG_SCSI_BFA
* qla2xxx - CONFIG_TCM_QLA2XXX
